My research project aims to understand what causes a food video on Tik Tok to be trending.  I break the trends into different categories, determined by the main reason the video is trending, for example, rethinking food, commodification, and challenges, etc.  In this project I aim to understand what makes a video trend on Tik Tok so that depending on if someone ever wants to make a trending food-tok video, they will know what methods are necessary to use.

The most significant takeaways were authenticity is not always necessary.  For rethinking food videos, authenticity and simplicity are the main methods used for their success.  These videos show the user that the person behind the trend is average and that anyone can be a master chef and usually for cheap.  This level of authenticity causes the audience to connect to one another based on different factors, but a main one is socioeconomic status, these trends are mainly for “middle class.”  This is different from the commodification trends, in which almost all of the videos are exactly alike the other.  There is a script in which the user has to almost follow, and no matter what video is watched, it resembles the others.  In this way, the video is trending because of its extreme opinions as well as its lack of authenticity.  The audience watches these to see if it is the same as the last video they watched in hopes this user does not like the chamoy pickle for example, but alas, more often than not this is not achieved.

The biggest challenge I ran into was the citing method.  I was able to go through and write consistently, and then after I had to go and hyperlink articles to give more information on the trends, as well as to include different tik tok videos in my website.  The software I used had given me a lot of issues.  So while I was writing there was not much difficulty during the process, I often found myself going back on my work and revising after I lost the inspiration flow and making the paragraphs smaller.  One thing I think I could have done better is make them smaller, but I tried to be cohesive and have effective transitions where they made sense in my writing.

The aspects of my project I would like the most feedback on is on the argument.  I think I am able to explain the trends and their general purpose based on their categories, but I want to make sure there is an argument being made, so if an individual wanted to make a trend on TikTok they would be able to.  For each different category I summarize my findings in a small paragraph, but at the end, I wrap up and write conclusions about each trend as well as further implications such as what negative effects may be of such trends.  I want to make sure I have an argument, which is to highlight why different trends work and show the differences between the trends.  I do not want my work to be just informative about what the trends are, and I want to be knowledgeable to prove I researched my topic in a manner which makes sense.
