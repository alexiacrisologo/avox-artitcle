Have you heard of baked feta pasta?  What about chocolate covered strawberries?  Perhaps a chamoy pickle?  What about girl dinner?  All of the terms above are seemingly very simple and seem obvious, but each has held their individual reign over Tik Tok.  Now, you may ask, how were chocolate covered strawberries trending on Tik Tok?  They're a well known dessert which is a common sweet treat to indulge.  Well, after observing the trends it's easy to see the pattern, so let's look into what really causes these food trends to captivate us users.  

**Rethinking Food:**

Starting off, [girl dinner](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/girldinner),[@girl_dinner] a trend started by [Olivia Maher](https://www.tiktok.com/@liviemaher/video/7232130214506057003),[@Jennings] has evolved into many [different paths](https://www.vox.com/culture/23831903/girl-dinner-tiktok-trends-hot-girl-walk). Originally, she posted what she was eating for dinner, cheese, grapes and bread to indulge in her "medieval" cravings. The trend started to pick up speed and was seen as a way to promote positivity about feeding [indulgences](https://www.aol.com/tried-21-energy-drink-brands-211400312.html) [@Martin]as well as to support other girls in their eating habits. 

A notable adaptation was the interchangeability of girl dinner and sweet treats. [Sweet treats](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/sweet-treats?lang=en) [@sweet_treat]were seen as a post dinner snack such as a Starbucks drink or even a piece of chocolate. The evolution of this trend makes it hard to designate an exact timeframe in which it was trending for, but for the moment it has been around for nearly a year. While some think the trend is dead or "cheugy" [@Jennings], in my opinion, this trend is still circulating as seen in the Tik Tok published March 3, 2024 by [@alllthingsfood].

I see no end in sight because of the immense adaptations it has take on. For example trends such as the famous chocolate covered strawberries, the comments are flooding with hashtags mentioning girl dinner. This trend is important in the food realm of Tik Tok, especially after a video of chocolate covered strawberries emerged. Under an instrumental sound, someone recorded a 15 second video of strawberries. It gained 49 million likes in 2 months, which is the second most liked video, behind [Bella Poarch's lip sync to M to the B](https://www.tiktok.com/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445?lang=en) [@Bella_Poarch]. Verified accounts such as the [Baltimore Orioles](https://www.tiktok.com/@orioles?lang=en) [@Baltimore_Orioles] even commented, confused on how the trend was so successful:

```

This trend has adapted to more than just food. Mimicking the style of the strawberry video, people will record things they love with flash to the same audio by Cadwell, for example, this video of a cat by user [@chillestcat]:

```

Let's delve into the strawberries first for a bit. What is it about these strawberries that made the video receive as many likes as it did? Well, for starters because the ingredients are so simple, people watching started to crave the items. They felt they could recreate the video for cheap. Because of its simplicity and affordability, the trend was so successful. There is also an aspect of authenticity since it is shown on an individual's bed. Compared to advertisements like the chamoy pickles which I will delve into later, the content creator is simply showing off her snack rather than forcing us to try.

There are some extreme opinions in the comments mentioning their anger with how popular the video is when all it did was record [strawberries with melted chocolate](https://www.today.com/food/trends/chocolate-covered-strawberries-viral-tiktok-video-rcna140216)[@choc_strawberries], but this just added to the popularity. When people started recreating this trend in its different variations, in the comments people would search for the original to understand the context of the videos, which caused the video to gain an even larger outreach. Similar to girl dinner, the derivatives of this trend are endless, and have a way to show off something they love as a simple indulgence.

The next trend, [baked feta pasta](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tik-tok-pasta-recipe_l_6022cfacc5b689330e332dfa), was popular in the year of 2021.  [CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/29/us/tiktok-food-trends-youth-trnd/index.html) that the grocery chain, [Harris Teeter](https://www.harristeeter.com/), reported a 200% jump in block feta sales during the peak of this trend in February 2021.  Similar to all the rethinking food options so far, this trend is popular because of its simplicity which allows replicability as well as recognizable ingredients.  In this way, anyone can feel like a food celebrity CNN states, how foodie culture shifts to not just be high end foodies, but something more focused on the middle class.

Here is an example of a feta pasta Tik Tok from user [@feelgoodfoodie]:

```{r tiktok-4}

```

This trend shows users putting a block of [feta cheese](https://www.harristeeter.com/p/boar-s-head-creamy-feta-cheese/0004242105971?searchType=default_search) in a pan with tomatoes, oil, pepper, garlic, etc and placing it in the oven, then combining with pasta when its removed.  This viral sensation rethinks a recipe which is so simple and makes individuals more motivated to cook.  There are different variations based on the type of pasta used as well as if there are extra ingredients.  One reason it was trending was the satisfaction which users had after taking it out of the oven and mixing the melted cheese thoroughly throughout the rest of the dish.

Back when this trend was at its peak, I tried it, and I can say it is extremely fun, simple, and a tasty way to have an inexpensive meal.  This truly is a trend for everyone since my cooking abilities are not the best, which is why with basic cooking skills, trends can skyrocket.

Overall, rethinking food gains popularity through common skills and ingredients, showing how anyone can be a chef as well as motivating individuals to create their own trends if they also have a simple recipe which they would like to show off to the world.  This is a very authentic style of trend, where real people show their steps and connect with other users in the comments about how simple and delicious the recipes are.
